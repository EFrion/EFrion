<ins><i>Context</i></ins>: Cosmological models in which Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) are described by a single component, dubbed Unified Dark Matter (UDM) models, can have an equation state $$<−1$$ at late times without violating the null energy condition. I investigated whether this feature can relieve the Hubble tension. 

<ins><i>Method</i></ins>: I performed a Bayesian analysis of the model using SNIa data from Pantheon, the CMB distance prior from Planck, and the prior on the absolute magnitude $$M$$ of SNIa from SH0ES. I modified the CLASS code to implement the UDM model, and performed a MCMC analysis with MontePython. The statistical analysis and the figures were then obtained with GetDist. We also discuss the importance of using the prior on $$M$$ for constraining this model. 

<ins><i>Results</i></ins>:
* The data suggests a smooth transition taking place at redshifts $$z \simeq 2.85$$...
* ... which provides a value of $$H_0=69.64±0.88$$ for the Hubble constant, slightly alleviating the tension by $$\approx 1.5\sigma$$.
