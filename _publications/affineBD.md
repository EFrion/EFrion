<ins><i>Context</i></ins>: The question of frame equivalence in modified gravity is still open. I introduced with Carla
Almeida (São Paulo University, Brazil) the affine quantisation of the Brans-Dicke theory (BDT),
which is a quantisation procedure based on continuous wavelet analysis, widely used to recover data
from singularities in a signal. A mathematical model describing a physical system is scale-dependent,
and the arbitrariness in the choice of the wavelet ψ allows to probe the system at different scales.

<ins><i>Method</i></ins>: I applied the affine quantisation to the Hamiltonian constraint of the BDT in both Jordan
and Einstein frames, and analysed the differences between the two Wheeler-deWitt (WdW) equations.
After, I used the separability of the WdW equation in the Einstein frame to find the wavefunction of
the Universe and its energy spectrum. Finally, I calculated the expectation value of the scalar field
and the scale factor to depict the semi-classical behaviour of the system using Mathematica.

<ins><i>Results</i></ins>:
* I proved that unitarity in both frames depends on the arbitrary wavelet only, i.e. an infinite
number of unitarily equivalent models exist, hinting towards the equivalence between frames.
* In the Einstein frame, I was able to find a discrete energy spectrum.
* At the semi-classical level, the self-adjointness of the kinetic operator gives a smooth bounce...
* ...and surprisingly, there must be an upper limit on the velocity of the scalar field, otherwise the
semi-classical solutions diverge in both frames.
