<ins><i>Context</i></ins>: An interesting model of quantum bouncing cosmology, composed of a single scalar field with exponential potential, describes a phase of dark energy while being consistent with CMB observations. I investigated whether this model could also explain the origins of large-scale galactic fields. 

<ins><i>Method</i></ins>: This paper uses the same method as in [2004.07269](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07269): starts the slow contraction phase with an adiabatic vacuum in the far past, analyse the Hamilton equations of the gauge fields, and compute the numerical evolution with the NumCosmo library.

<ins><i>Results</i></ins>:
* Well-defined vacuum.
* No backreaction from the electromagnetic field on the background.
* The electric and magnetic power spectra are time depenent, with spectral indices between 0 and 4.
* Amplitude of magnetic fields consistent with observations on scales $$>1$$ Megaparsec!
