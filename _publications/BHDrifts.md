<ins><i>Context</i></ins>: Together with Leonardo Giani and Tays Miranda, I recently led a study that demonstrates how redshift drifts alter the apparent angular diameter of black holes' shadows and the frequency of their photon rings over time in a McVittie spacetime. This particular spacetime model replicates the behavior of Schwarzschild black holes at small scales and the Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker metric at large scales. By applying this technique, we not only placed limits on the gravitational coupling but also on the maximum accretion rate of supermassive black holes.

<ins><i>Method</i></ins>: In McVittie, the angular diameter of a shadow is intimately tied to its Schwarzschild radius and angular diameter distance. I computed the relative changes in the shadow's size over time based on the black hole mass (M) and distance (G) functions of time. Subsequently, I used data from the Event Horizon Telescope to test M87* while initially assuming a stationary black hole in general relativity, therefore determining the effect of dark energy on the shadow. After eliminating the assumption of stationarity, I established a threshold for the variation in G and M. Ultimately, I expanded my research to include photon rings, which, in the future, should provide more precise measurements.

<ins><i>Results</i></ins>:
* Through this methodology, I found that redshift drifts presented a limit on the relative temporal changes to the gravitational coupling of approximately $$10^{-3} - 10^{-4}$$ per year using data from the EHT's M87*. 
* Upon the presumption that General Relativity is the correct gravitational theory, I concluded that the shadows and photon rings offer insight into M87*'s maximum accretion rate, approximated at a rate of about $$10^5 M_{\odot}$$ per year.
