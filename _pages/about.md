Hi! Welcome to my page! My site is still under construction, but you can still find the most important information about me. 



About my academic background
======

In 2009, I realise astrophysics is what makes me vibe and decide to enroll in the physics course of the nearest university (Lille 1). I learn about the different academic career paths and, after a conversation with the instructor of my statistical physics course, I apply to enroll to the Paris Observatory (Paris-Meudon, in fact, they insist about it!), and go there to attend an. I successfully pass the interview to my big surprise, which remains one of the 


A reminder to myself about how I got into cosmology
======

I come from a small village in the North of France in which the number of inhabitants is less than the number of cows. A very small, outlaying village, in which contact with nature is perpetual. The days were full of animals to discover, the nights full of bright stars. My dad was the first person to talk to me about stars. About how they form, how they die, how what we see in the sky might already be gone... He was always so proud when he talked about Einstein's theory of relativity! He was no expert, but he always felt such a strong fascination about what nature has to offer. His fascination for the world was a gift he passed on to me. He and my mom always gave me their support, which helped me overcome the many barriers I encountered until I became the first academic of the family. I know you are proud of me, mom, dad, but I am so much more proud of you both. I love you very dearly, mom. I miss you so much, dad. Thank you both for everything.

{% comment %} Learning was always so much fun as a child. I believe I was excelling in elementary school because of that.

I hated middle school and high school. Physics was the most boring course I had then, and this from the first lesson in middle school until I entered my last year of high school. In fact, my grades in all science courses were disastrous. Incidentally, when I was 15, I got internet at home, which was the time I started to learn about physics on my own. It was such a cool breeze to spend countless hours reading about cosmology, particle physics, string theory on Wikipedia. My last year of high school was another step towards <i>thinking</i> about physics as a career path. During that year, I was lucky enough to have the best physics teacher since I had started school, Mr. Assal. Serious, funny, and kind at the same time. He cared about explaining physics to the students without ever blaming whoever had low grades. He abhorred laziness though, and kept pushing the students out of their comfort zone. His compassion, his empathy, and his efforts to make people understand were essential in motivating me when I was at my lowest. I will always be grateful for that.
