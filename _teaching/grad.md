I was also a teaching assistant for three graduate students courses during my PhD. I prepared exercises and explained their solutions in a course of Quantum Mechanics administered by Júlio César Fabris. The course was for Master's students. I also wrote lectures notes of two courses aimed at graduate students. The first set of notes was about quantum aspects of black holes, administered by Marc Casal. The second was about the $$3+1$$ separation of General Relativity, administered by my supervisor Nelson Pinto-Neto.
