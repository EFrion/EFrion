In 2020, Vincent Vennin (APC, France) and David Wands (ICG, UK) started an International Emergent Action with the aim of gathering experts of stochastic effects in cosmology. I was invited to join the collaboration and to give a talk during the first workshop, in which I presented the pioneering work about the implementation of [stochastic effects in a collapsing universe](/publications/stochColl) I published with my wife Tays and David Wands.
