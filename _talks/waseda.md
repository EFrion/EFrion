I gave a talk at the "Japanese General Relativity and Gravitation Workshop", in which I presented my publication about the [black hole shadow and photon ring drift](/publications/BHDrifts), focusing in particular on the possibility of testing the Equivalence Principle by relating a temporal variation of the gravitational coupling to a variation of either the size of a  shadow or of a photon ring.
