[Description of the event here!](https://caps.ncsa.illinois.edu/conferences/cosmo21/)

COSMO is one of the biggest event in cosmology, and I had the opportunity to present a poster online in the 21 edition. I presented the key points of my research paper about [magnetogenesis in a bouncing universe](/publications/magnetoBounceDust).
