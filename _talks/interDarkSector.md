[Description of the event here!](https://www.cosmo-ufes.org/winfried.html)

This event was in homage of the 70th birthday of Winfried Zimdahl, a brilliant and kind German researcher who has strong ties with UFES. It took place at the National Institute of the Atlantic Forest (INMA) which, besides hosting research units, is also a centre of protection of endangered fauna and flora in the state of Espírito Santo. Another amazing place in Brazil, where I appreciated close encounters with many different species. I presented the same poster about inflationary primordial magnetogenesis than during the [Verão Quântico (Quantum Summer)](/talks/posterVQ) event.
