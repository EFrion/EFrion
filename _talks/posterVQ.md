[Description of the event here!](https://www.cosmo-ufes.org/vq2017.html)

The first event I presented my research! Ubu is a small paradisiac town in Brazil, which I highly recommend to anyone. I presented the work I did during my Master's degree about inflationary primordial magnetogenesis, which I extended later in my paper about [magnetogenesis in a bouncing universe](/publications/magnetoBounceDust) with my supervisor in Brazil, Nelson Pinto-Neto.
